A foray into Industrial Systems Engineering and Interface design from scratch. 

<!-- more -->

From a young age, I have been fascinated by cars. The roar of an engine, the thrill of speed, and the intricate beauty of their design have always captivated me. I spent countless hours poring over car magazines, learning about different makes and models, and dreaming of one day owning my own.

One of my earliest sources of automotive knowledge was the Gran Turismo video game series. I would spend hours meticulously studying the vehicle descriptions, learning about the different components and systems that make up a car. In fact, I can honestly say that I learned most of my English from reading those descriptions!

As I grew older, my interest in cars only intensified. I began to learn about automotive engineering, and I started to "mod" racing games such as Assetto Corsa. I would spend hours tweaking the settings and parameters of the cars in the game, trying to get them to perform as realistically as possible.

My passion for cars eventually led me to build my own simulation rig. I wanted to create a rig that would provide the most realistic and immersive driving experience possible. I used CanBUS to connect the rig to a powerful industrial servo motor, and I designed and built my own motor controller, driver, and power supply. I also designed and built my own steering wheel and quick release system, using PIO technology for the display and LED synchronization.

Building my own simulation rig was a challenging but rewarding experience. It allowed me to learn more about automotive engineering and to apply my knowledge in a practical way. The rig is capable of providing incredibly realistic feedback, and it has allowed me to take my sim racing to the next level.

I am still learning and growing as an automotive enthusiast. I am always eager to learn more about cars, and I am always looking for new ways to improve my sim racing skills. I am excited to see what the future holds for the automotive industry, and I can't wait to see how simulation technology will continue to evolve.
